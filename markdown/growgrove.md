growgrove (name subject to changes) is a web application focused on improving the users&apos; productivity, habits, and focus. Designed and developed by myself for the last subject of the career.

<br>
It has various tools, such as a to-do list, a calendar, and the main attraction: a "game" inspired by Forest, where you can set timers to work on tasks you previously created and grow your land to have a sense of rewards and progress.

The idea is to also give the user a record of their activities and tasks that are being completed, how much time they take/took, and more.

<br>
By making this project on my own, I could say that I had to fill the shoes of a full-stack developer. From defining the functional requirements of the application, to designing and creating the database, to creating each component, page, etc.
