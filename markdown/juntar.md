Juntar is a web application developed at college together with 10 classmates. It&apos;s an application to create and manage events related to the Universidad Nacional del Comahue.

<br>
My role within this project was, almost entirely, related to the front end. Some of the tasks I performed were the creation components, pages, changing styles and fixing some bugs.
