This application was developed for  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TantuBeats" target="_blank" style="border-bottom: 2px solid #f2f2f2; display: inline">Tantu Beats</a>, a music producer and beatmaker from the Netherlands, Europe.

<br>
Tantu approached me asking for a program where he could easily create youtube subtitles for people to freestyle over his beats.

<br>
The application creates a .sbv file (type of file used by youtube videos to show subtitles) and writes over it, taking random words from a list of 2048 words. These words appear in a mathematically calculated time, depending on the beat&apos;s bpm, start, and the total length of it.

<br>
See how it works <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nJ0wYBN3t4" target="_blank" style="border-bottom: 2px solid #f2f2f2; display: inline">here</a> (turn on the captions)
